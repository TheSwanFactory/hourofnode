## Turning event-driven programming into child's play

### Introduction

The Hour of Node is a web application designed to teach the basics of computer programming to kids of all ages, backgrounds, and experience levels.

It includes:

 * **TurtleVerse 2D**, a simple yet extensible game engine 
 * A **Graphical Command Interface** (GCI) that seamlessly incorporates both playing and programming the game engine
 * A **Tutorial** that teaches kids how to interact with and program the game engine

We believe this is the first comprehensive programming environment -- GUI, game engine, runtime, and document format -- designed from the ground up for kids (and the iPad). Our goal is to build something simple enough for grade-schoolers to learn in an hour, yet rich enough to keep teenagers busy for days. 

### Usage

The application is available live on the web at http://hourofnode.org/.

If you wish to run it locally using this GitHub project, please see INSTALL.md.

Additional documentation for developers is in the doc/ directory.

We recommend the cross-platform [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) editor for viewing and modifying the `.coffee` [CoffeeScript](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-coffeescript) source files and `.md` [MarkDown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) documentation files.

### History

We began development on October 1st, 2014, and plan to launch on December 8th, 2014 for CS Education Week (aka [The Hour of Code](http://code.org)).

We live-cast, and store podcasts of, our coding sessions at:
