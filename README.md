The Hour of Node
================

Turning event-driven programming into child's play

Introduction
============

The Hour of Node is a single-page web application designed to teach event-driven programming
to kids of all ages, backgrounds, and experience levels. It includes:
  * TurtleVerse 2D, a simple yet extensible game engine 
  * A Graphical Command Interface (GCI) that seamlessly incorporates both playing and programming the game engine
  * Tutorial levels that teach kids how to use the GCI and TurtleVerse 2D
  
Our goal is to build something simple enough for grade-schoolers to learn in an hour,
yet rich enough to keep teenagers busy for days.

We believe it is the first comprehensive programming environment -- GUI, game engine, runtime, and document format --
designed from the ground up for kids (and the iPad).
