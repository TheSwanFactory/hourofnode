## Turning event-driven programming into child's play

### Introduction

The Hour of Node is a web application designed to teach the basics of computer programming to kids of all ages, backgrounds, and experience levels.  

It includes:

 * **TurtleVerse 2D**, a simple yet extensible game engine 
 * A **Graphical Command Interface** (GCI) that seamlessly incorporates both playing and programming the game engine
 * A **Tutorial** that teaches kids how to interact with and program the game engine

We believe this is the first comprehensive programming environment -- GUI, game engine, runtime, and document format -- designed from the ground up for kids (and the iPad). Our goal is to build something simple enough for grade-schoolers to learn in an hour, yet rich enough to keep teenagers busy for days. 

We began development on October 1st, 2014, and plan to launch on December 8th, 2014 for CS Education Week (aka The Hour of Code).

We live-cast, and store podcasts of, our coding sessions at:
