### Installation Steps (Prerequisite Software/Utilties) ###

1.) Install Git
  Download it from here: http://git-scm.com/downloads

2.) Install node.js
  Download it from here: http://nodejs.org/download/

### Installation Steps (The Hour of Node web-app) ###
3.) Download The Hour of Node web-application as a ZIP file
  Downlod it from here: https://github.com/TheSwanFactory/hourofnode/archive/master.zip
  Other downloading options are:
  * Forking the project: "Fork" button on upper right of this page: https://github.com/TheSwanFactory/hourofnode/
  * Use the "Clone in Desktop" button

4.) Launch a terminal
  Mac OS: Utilities
  Windows: CMD Prompt or CYGWIN

5.) Create a directory [on the partition] where you'd like The Hour of Node web-application to reside and be served-up from.

6.) Unzip the downloaded The Hour Of Node .zip file to that directory (Step 5)

The following steps will be done inside the terminal
7.) Install gulp (via npm)
    --> npm -g install gulp

8.) Install CoffeeScript (via npm)
    --> npm -g install coffee-script

9.) Install Reactive-Coffee (via npm)
    --> npm -g install reactive-coffee

10.) Install the 'underscore' module (via npm
    --> npm install underscore

11.) You **may** need to download and unzip reactive-coffee from here:
http://yang.github.io/reactive-coffee
Either click the ".zip file" link (Windows), or click the ".tar.gz file" (Apple OS/UNIX) link
  Unzip the zipped file's contents into the parent directory that contains The Hour of Node's install directory.  

Unix Example:
If The Hour of Node web-app was unzipped into /opt/hourofnode
Then reactive-coffee's tar.gz file's contents should be gunzipped into: /opt/reactive-coffee

Windows Example:
If The Hour of Node web-app was unzipped into C:\temp\hourofnode
Then reactive-coffee's .zip file's contents should be unzipped into: C:\temp\reactive-coffee

12.) npm packages **may** need to be updated - try doing this if errors occur when attempting to serve-up The Hour of Node web-app with 'gulp' 
    --> npm update

### Launching The Hour of Node web-app ###
In the terminal (or Windows CMD prompt):
1.) Change directory to the top directory where The Hour of Node resides
(i.e. Unix: /opt/hourofnode)
(i.e. Windows: C:\temp\hourofnode)

2.) Type the command: gulp
    --> gulp

A successful start-up of The Hour of Node web-app should result in lines similar to these (in the terminal):
    [20:09:00] Requiring external module coffee-script/register
    [20:09:04] Using gulpfile c:\Temp\hourofnode\gulpfile.coffee
    [20:09:04] Starting 'main'...
    [20:09:04] Starting 'sync'...
    [20:09:04] Finished 'sync' after 67 ms
    [20:09:04] Starting 'watch'...
    [20:09:04] Finished 'watch' after 55 ms
    [BS] Local URL: http://localhost:3000
    [BS] Serving files from: web
    [BS] Watching files...
    [BS] File changed: c:\Temp\hourofnode\web\main.js
    [20:09:06] Finished 'main' after 2.57 s
    [20:09:06] Starting 'default'...
    [20:09:06] Finished 'default' after 8.55 Âµs
