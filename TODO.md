# Ship Week TODO List

Our success criteria is David's Tutorial Level, which you can currently view (but not yet solve) at http://hourofnode.org/?game=tutorial&level=10

## App 
@danielma

The hourofnode.org app must be able to:

 1. Evaluate a program that solves that level
 2. Program that solution using the GCI
 3. Recreate and share that level using the GCI

and look good while doing it!
 
## Pedagogy
@DrErnie

 * Build a tutorial game (or two) that teaches students to do the above
 * Explain to @approbo what concepts and skills they learn along the way

## GitHub 
@david

The hourofnode github project must be well-documented and welcoming enough that a motivated adult can do everything David did, but without all the pain: 

 * Download and run the app locally, even on Windows
 * Create a one-level game with turtle, exit, and walls
 * Submit it back to the project as a pull request

## Wordpress
@approbo

Acting on the assumption that we will succeed, the Wordpress site needs to tell the above stories in a way that inspires action by:

 * teachers
 * parents
 * students
 * programmers
 * the media
 
## Twitter
@audrey

Create Twitter Lists on the @hour_of_node Twitter account by following and retweeting influential or outspoken:

 * educators
 * programmers
 * media
 * institutions
 * public figures
 
who are already talking about the Hour of Code, and may be receptive to hearing about the Hour of Node.
